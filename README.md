# Opel kadett odometer repair using arduino

This file contains arduino software, that was used to repair Opel Kadett GSI LCD odometer. Original odometer was mechanical,
and it's platic gear was destroyed because of aging. So I removed original mechanical odometer unit and replaced it with 1602 LCD screen.
